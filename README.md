# ***The Nglish Programming language***
This is a text-based programming language that lets you write intuitive and readable english instructions, that will then be interpreted. It is inspired from the *English Programming Language* (a joke language) and the *Plain Text Language* (not very good). We are aiming to create a modern, not very efficient, but easy to code language with *Object Oriented Programming*.

# How to setup
1. Install python.
2. ``python main.py [file to interpret]``
3. Watch it run. *(it walks instead)*

# How to code in Nglish
**Everything is text, or can be text.**

For example, to create a variable or assign a value to a variable, one must write:\
``my_variable is equal to 5.``

And to do arithmetic, one can use the python operators (+, -, *, /, **) or text:\
``x equals 55 divided by 10 plus 1.25.``\
As you can also see, some things can have different spellings / ways of writing them, which is cool.

For conditions, the syntax is close to *python* and *lua*, just in plain english:
```
if x is greater or equals to y and x is not zero, then
    print x.
```
**Yes, numbers can be also written as text**
